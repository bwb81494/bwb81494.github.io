		<p>I would like to start by saying, this is nothing like To Pimp a Butterfly! You probably already knew this if you listened to DAMN.'s first single HUMBLE., a Mike Will Made-It produced banger. However, if you are still craving more jazz and fuck influenced conscious rap, you should look elsewhere. I suggest checking out his To Pimp a Butterfly b-sides, <A href = "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/untitled-unmastered/id1089846273">Untitled Unmastered.</A><br><br>In DAMN., Kendrick embarks on a journey that sees him at his most angry, unsure, and scattered. On the albums chilling first track, BLOOD., we hear kendrick approach an elderly woman, asking if had lost something. Without responding for a while, she tells Kendrick that he is the one who has lost something, his life. Bang! Kendrick is killed and a soundbite begins to play. We begin to hear what is later revealed to be FOX news reporters, expressing their distaste for Kendrick's live performance of the his hit single "Alright", from To Pimp a Butterfly. After this fades out, we are hit over the head with booming bass and energetic, in-your-face rapping from Lamar. To be continued...</p>
